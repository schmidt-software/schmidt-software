# 👋 About Me
Hi, I'm Michael — a passionate software developer and system architect with over 30 years of experience. I thrive on solving complex problems, building robust systems, and exploring the ever-evolving world of technology. Curiosity is my fuel, and innovation is my playground.

# 💻 What I Do
From backend development to system administration and architectural design, I enjoy crafting efficient, scalable solutions. I'm currently in a permanent role, but always open to new challenges that push boundaries and spark creativity.

 #🔧 DIY Mentality
I live by the mantra: "If you can break it, you can fix it." Whether it's hardware, software, or something in between — I believe in rolling up my sleeves and figuring things out.

# 🐾 Life Beyond Code
I'm a proud father, husband, and the tamer of two dogs and two cats. My family keeps me grounded and inspired — they’re my greatest source of joy and motivation.
