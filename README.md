Software Developer | Linux Enthusiast | Open Source Advocate | Always Curious | Do-It-Yourselfer | Proud Father, Husband and dog and (a little bit) cat lover.

### About Me

Hello! I'm Michael, a passionate software developer with over 30 years of experience in the industry. Since my beginnings, I've developed a special preference for Linux systems and open-source software, considering them as the driving force behind creativity and productivity.

### What I Do

I love coding and developing innovative solutions, be it in backend development, system administration, or software architecture. My curiosity constantly drives me to explore new technologies and expand my knowledge.

### Why Linux?

Linux, for me, is not just an operating system but a way of life. The flexibility, control, and stability it provides allow me to unleash my full potential as a developer. Additionally, I value the community and the principles underlying the open-source philosophy.

### DIY Mentality

I'm a advocate of the Do-It-Yourself approach. Whether it's setting up a home network, tinkering with hardware projects, or experimenting with new programming languages, I love taking things into my own hands and learning how they work.

### Family

Aside from my passion for technology, I'm a proud father and husband. My family is my greatest inspiration. Tamer of two dogs and two cats.
