Software Developer | Linux Enthusiast | Open Source Advocate | Always Curious | Do-It-Yourselfer

### About Me

Hello! I'm Michael, a passionate software developer with over 30 years of experience in the industry.

### What I Do

I love coding and developing innovative solutions, be it in backend development, system administration, or software architecture. My curiosity constantly drives me to explore new technologies and expand my knowledge. Stuck in a permanent position, but always looking for a challenge

### DIY Mentality

I'm a advocate of the Do-It-Yourself approach. If you can break it, you can fix it.

### Family

Aside from my passion for technology, I'm a father and husband. My family is my greatest inspiration. Tamer of two dogs and two cats.
